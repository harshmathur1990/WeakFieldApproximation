1. Plot Intensity Contour on other maps to identify the pore in line core image, temperature, magnetic field and velocity maps.
2. Use The photospheric lines in Ca II and H alpha to constrain magnetic field.
3. Use 3 nodes in Vlos.
4. Use H alpha flat data to correct for stray light contrast degradation.
